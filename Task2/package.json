  "description": "Create a Node.js Express backend server that handles a POST request /faucet accepting parameters for a CosmosHub address and an Ethereum address. The server performs the following tasks: ● Stores the private key used to deploy the smart contract from Part 1 in a text file ● Listens for POST requests to /faucet with a body containing an Ethereum address and a CosmosHub address. ● Validates if the CosmosHub address is a Simply Staking delegator by querying the Cosmos Hub Api (not mintscan) through a public REST endpoint which can be found here. Important to choose REST and not RPC. You can also use: https://spectrum-01.simplystaking.xyz/cosmos/mainnet/lhgwTP39mKNxkg ● Checks the ERC20 smart contract to determine if a claim has already been made for the provided CosmosHub address. ● Returns an error if a claim has already been made for the CosmosHub address or if the address is not a delegator. ● If eligible, calls the faucet function in the ERC20 smart contract using Ethers.js, using the stored private key, to transfer tokens to the provided Ethereum address and returns the transaction hash.",
